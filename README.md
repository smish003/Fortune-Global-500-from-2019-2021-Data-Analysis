<h1>Fortune Global 500 from 2019-2021 Data Analysis</h1>

**Project Overview:**

The **Fortune Global 500**, is an annual ranking of the worldâ€™s top 500 companies based on their revenue. The ranking is significantly influenced by a variety of factors, 
including the global economy, trade policies, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate instability. For this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the **Fortune Global 500 dataset**, 
focusing on the alterations that occurred between the years **2019 and 2021**.

The dataset includes key columns such as:
* **Company name**
* **Business sector**
* **Industry type**
* **Revenue generated**
* **Changes in revenue**
* **Profits earned**
* **Profit changes**
* **Assets**
* **Number of employees**
* **Headquarters location**
  
After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, several key observations were made:

1. **Sector Popularity:** The financial sector emerged as one of the most prominent sectors, while the Hotels, Restaurants, and Leisure sector ranked the lowest among other sectors.

2. **Industry Popularity:** Within industries, Commercial and Savings Banks proved to be the most dominant, outperforming other industries in terms of popularity and ranking.

3. **Headquarters Location:** The majority of companies in the Fortune Global 500 have their headquarters in Beijing, with Tokyo ranking second in the number of corporate headquarters.

4. **Outlier Detection:** Using statistical methods like box plots, the following observations were made:
* In the sector variable, outliers were detected beyond the 0.1 threshold.
* The industry variable displayed outliers beyond the 0.05 threshold.
* A considerable number of outliers were identified in the headquarters city variable.
* Interestingly, there were no outliers detected for the company values (revenue, profits, etc.).

This investigation sheds light on the dynamic nature of global rankings, highlighting the impact of economic, geopolitical, and corporate changes. The insights from this analysis can serve as a foundation for understanding business trends and strategic decision-making for enterprises in the global market.
